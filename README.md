# WeatherWhisper
Weather Dashboard with dynamically updating HTML and CSS.  This project was so much fun.  Messing with the API and getting the weather forecast to work just right and display cleanly was quite the challenge.  I learned so much about css on this project although there was quite a bit of javascript that was challenging enough.  Please enjoy the application!!!!
